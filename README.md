# Speak-Notes

The app transcribes speech into text, using the JavaScript Web Speech API,
it allows to download the transcript as a text file.
As it is a somewhat new API, you might have to update your browser, and no support from Firefox.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
